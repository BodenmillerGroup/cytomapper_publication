Highly-multiplexed imaging acquires the spatial expression of multiple biological molecules such as RNA and proteins (here referred to as "markers"). 
Such data is usually represented as multi-channel images where each channel contains the pixel-intensities of individual molecules. 
A common step in multiplexed imaging analysis is image segmentation to obtain the outlines of individual cells and quantify cell-specific features such as marker expression, spatial location and morphology.
Multiple GUI-based tools, such as `histoCAT`, `giotto`, `cytokit`, `ImaCytE` and `CytoMAP`, have been developed to quide users through multiplexed imaging analyses.
Those tools however lack full reproducibility and are limited by a small set of selected algortihms.
Here, we present [cytomapper](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cytomapper.html), a Bioconductor package for visualizing highly-multiplexed imaging data. 
The `cytomapper` package builds up on the `EBImage` functionality to visualize imaging data in R and the `SingleCellExperiment` container to store cell-specific expression and metadata.

## Getting help

For a full documentation, please refer to the vignette (`vignette("cytomapper")`) or the individual help functions (e.g. `?plotCells`).

## Basic functionailty

The `cytomapper` package offers three main functions: `plotCells`, `plotPixels` and `cytomapperShiny`

### The `plotCells` function

The `plotCells` function takes at least a `CytoImageList` object to visualize segmentation masks.
When additionally providing a `SingleCellExperiment` object, masks can be coloured based on the cells' expression or their metadata (e.g. cell-type).
The `cytomapper` package supports subsetting of the `SingleCellExperiment` object to only visualize a selected subset of cells.

### The `plotPixels` function

The `plotPixels` function requires at least a multi-channel image `CytoImageList` object.
By default, the first marker is visualized.
Displayed markers can be selected by by setting `colour_by` to the entries in `channelNames(images)`.
Furthermore, a `SingleCellExperiment` object and a `CytoImageList` segmentation mask object can be supplied to outline cells on images.

### The `cytomapperShiny` function

The `cytomapper` package provides a Shiny app, which can be used to hierarchically gate cells based on their expression and to visualize selected cells on images.
This approach can be useful to robustly label cells based on their cell-type. 
A classifier can be trained using these labels and classify the remaining cells.
